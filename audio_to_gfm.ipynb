What do you talk about? What about what about Tyler? Oh, you mentioned in the in the five things, there's a martial revolutions piece. What about national health insurance?\n","\n","Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We'll we'll talk about that.\n","\n","Yeah. So people hate health insurers. They love, love, love doctors. And they well and they and they're sort of, I think, sort of neutral toward hospital themselves because of how they interact with these people. When you go when you go to the medical system, right, suppose I have a pain in my neck.\n","\n","Alright. That happened to me. I herniated some discs or at least one disc in my neck, maybe 2, I think. So I went to the doctor. The doctor, you know, the the receptionist is like, oh my god.\n","\n","Let me get you scheduled right away. The nurse is like, oh my gosh. That's so horrible. You know, they don't ask me for money upfront. They just give care.\n","\n","And if you know, everybody loves the word care. We care for you. And the nurse comes and the nurse says, where does it hurt? Just tell me where it hurts. They don't ask for money.\n","\n","This isn't a business. I'm here to care for you. Tell me where it hurts. And the doctor says, here's what I'm gonna do for you. I'm gonna prescribe you this MRI.\n","\n","I'm gonna prescribe you these medications. I'm gonna do all these things. Then you go and get the MRI. And the technician is like, oh, you know, here. Let me give you a pillow for your head.\n","\n","They just they provide care. They don't ask you for money at all. Then you go home and the medical portal tells you, you have a bill. Right? Your bill is for $2,000 for this MRI.\n","\n","And then you look, you're like, $2,000? Why didn't my insurance cover it? And then you see that it did. And the actual amount they billed was $10,000 for an MRI. You can get MRI for free for free.\n","\n","You can get MRI for, you know, for a $1,000 at SimonMed Imaging. UCSF was charging $10,000 for an MRI. Part of that is because they have a they send it out to a specialized radiologist who then takes a quick look and is like, ah, herniated disc. Cool. And then sends it back.\n","\n","But 10 like, you're getting charged as much and now I have a $2,000 MRI bill. This really happened to me. Those are actual numbers. Did the doctor who prescribed the MRI know how much it was gonna cost? I don't know.\n","\n","But they didn't even look into it. And they didn't certainly didn't tell me about it. And they sir certainly, when they they set up the appointment with UCSF, instead of saying, oh, would you rather get it a cheaper place at SimonMed, which charges literally 10% of the price, They didn't even consider that. Right? They didn't even think about this.\n","\n","They didn't even offer me the chance. They didn't give me a heads up. They they may have looked into it and just kept it from me or they may have not looked into it, but it wasn't in their incentives. It wasn't in their considerations for what they did. They're just like, I provide care.\n","\n","Then later, you get the bill. The insurance company plays the bad guy. You know? Hey, insurance company. Why didn't you cut why didn't you cover all of the $10,000?\n","\n","Why did you only cover $8,000 of the $10,000? You assholes. What do I pay you for? And what if they had denied coverage? Plenty of people get denied coverage for stuff.\n","\n","You know? And and so then the insurance company is is the bad guy. They're hired to play the bad guy, but who's actually getting the money? If you look at the profits of insurers, right, your typical health insurance company makes a profit margin of 1 to 3%. The average profit margin of the S and P 500 is 12%.\n","\n","And these insurers are out there making 1 to 3%. They're basically operating at cost. This is practically a nonprofit organization. Right? And, UnitedHealth Group, the, you know, the so the guy that murdered Brian Thompson was was CEO of UnitedHealthcare, which is a subsidiary.\n","\n","That's the health insurance subsidiary of a broader company called UnitedHealth Group. UnitedHealth Group itself does other lines of business such as being a health care provider, doing pharma stuff, and they make all the profit on that. So they have a profit margin of 6%. Whole group has a profit margin 6% up to half of the s and p average. And it's because they have these non insurance arms.\n","\n","Their insurer is has shit profitability too. Health insurers don't make any profit. Right? They'll pay their executives, like, a bit of money, but they they don't really make any profit. And so so if if health insurers, you know, chose to become nonprofits and to donate every single cent of their profits to you getting cheaper health care, right, your health care costs would go down by a tiny percent.\n","\n","You know, maybe like like 1 to 3%. And if if UnitedHealthcare if UnitedHealth Group donated all their profits to you, it would only go down by, like, a small and so the you know, the reason you're paying all this money, the reason I paid $2,000 out of a $10,000 cost for a fucking MRI was not because of my health insurer. It was because of my provider. It was because the hospital charged that much. It was because the people they outsource stuff to, the people they paid for the MRI machine or the people they the radiologist that they sent this thing off to and those people, those people charge a lot too.\n","\n","But the hospital, UCSF charge an arm and a leg for this service that I could get for a $1,000 at SimonMed. You know, it and it was also because the doctors and the people who processed my appointment are no one in the system had any incentive to tell me ahead of time how much this was gonna cost me. You know, no one had any incentive. I I don't know if the doctor knew. My doctor's a great doctor.\n","\n","I love my love my doctor, but but my doctor didn't think about the cost and isn't paid to think about the cost. And so we the people who are actually charging us are hospital administrators that we never interact with. Those are the people who charge us an arm and a leg for care. Right? And it's not the insurer.\n","\n","The insurer is making, like, almost 0 profits here. And that's just a fact that people don't understand because their interactions with the insurer is so negative and so adversarial. And they know the insurer has this toxic incentive to deny them care, to deny them coverage. I mean, not to deny them care, but to deny them coverage To say, oh, you got this thing. We're not gonna pay for it.\n","\n","Right? Like, that's a toxic adversary relationship. That's a negative incentive in the system. And they know this, and yet they their interaction with the insurers are so negative that there's this there's this natural need or desire to to blame the insurer, to make the insurer the bad guy. But that's what the insurer has been paid a relatively paltry sum to do.\n","\n","Right? They're paid to play the the heavy. They're paid to play the bad guy just like when you pay McKinsey to come in and tell you to fire the people you're already gonna fire. Right? You pay some 23 year old McKinsey consultant right out of Stanford to come in and tell you, well, actually, you should fire this person this person, but that was already on your list of people to fire.\n","\n","You just wanted this asshole 23 year old to be the one to say it. You pay them to be the heavy. You pay them to be the bad guy, bad cop. Right? And so the provider gets to play good cop.\n","\n","The provider just provides you care. And so people naturally think that, like, the provider's giving them free care. Why isn't the health insurer paying for that? I pay you premium. Why aren't you pay why aren't you, you know, making this care be just as free to me as the as as the doctor made it seem when they delivered it.\n","\n","Right? But in fact, the money's going to the provider. That's who's taking your money. They seem nice, but they're taking all your money. That's what I\n"]}]}]}
