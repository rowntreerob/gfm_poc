# gfm_poc
prototyping GFM, OpenAI, Deepgram integration
## Jupyter Notebooks 
Notebooks provide documentation, special code-execution cells, allowing general access to coding, python, and AI. Try out Links below to a cloud feature called colab, a dashboard for running notebooks which can also provide overview presentation to a series of live code cells at a low level of detail where you can also view documentation details on what / how the series of coding steps work together at showing the feasibility of the concept.
  
Click the list selection for **audio_to_gfm.ipynb** and then use the colab button to open and run the various cells of the example. Deepgram , openai keys for API access are required in the notebook. They should be coded in a new file you add to the project.
- create .env file with the key values noted in .env.example
